    "# Predicting outbreaks of West Nile Virus\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiaolin Chen, Ph.D. Aug 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Here I analyze weather data and GIS data and predict whether or not West Nile virus is present, for a given time, location, and species. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis aim to answer the following questions:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. How predictive modeling could be used to inform actions that the City of Chicago might take and suggest any preventative actions.\n",
    "* To understand the factors that are related to / predictive of the spread of WNV, what modeling choices / evaluation metrics would be most appropriate?\n",
    "* What additional data might be relevant for understanding this problem?\n",
    "* Are there any lessons for future data collection efforts?\n",
    "* What weather conditions would we expect to impact mosquito populations? How would you investigate this using this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description \n",
    "(from https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus)\n",
    "West Nile virus (WNV) is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitoes. Around 20% of people who become infected with the virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2002, the first human cases of WNV were reported in Chicago. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitoes in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, this analysis predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for WNV. A more accurate method of predicting outbreaks of WNV in mosquitoes will help the City of Chicago and CDPH more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus. **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The relevant data for this challenge can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main dataset**:\n",
    "Train and test data include record ID, date that the WNV test is performed, the species of mosquitos, Id of the trap, number of mosquitoes caught in this trap, and trap location variables (approximate address, block number, street name, approximate address, latitude and longitude).\n",
    "The target label is whether West Nile Virus was present in these mosquitos (1= WNV is present,0= not present). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spray Data**:\n",
    "The City of Chicago also does spraying to kill mosquitos. You are given the GIS data for their spray efforts in 2011 and 2013. Spraying can reduce the number of mosquitos in the area, and therefore might eliminate the appearance of West Nile virus. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weather Data**:\n",
    "It is believed that hot and dry conditions are more favorable for West Nile virus than cold and wet. The weather data come from NOAA of the weather conditions of 2007 to 2014, during the months of the tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Map Data**:\n",
    "The map files mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.rds and mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.txt are from Open Streetmap and are primarily provided for use in visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean the dataset \n",
    "2. Engineer features \n",
    "3. Predictive models \n",
    "4. Present results\n",
    " \n",
    "Here I explore the data, construct and/or select features, and use those features in one or more predictive models. I follow an iterative approach, establishing an initial baseline of performance upon which subsequent efforts can build.\n",
